## üõ†Ô∏è C++ Code: Binary File Writer

### File: `src/*.cpp, *.c, *.h`

This code takes digitized waveform data and writes it to a custom `.DX2` binary format. The format includes:

- Per-event headers with event number, timestamp, etc.
- Per-channel blocks with waveform arrays and metadata

### Compiling:
```bash
g++ -o DxDataExtractor DigDataExt.cpp -std=c++11
```

### Running:
```bash
./DxDataExtractor calibration//DxSetup.txt input_file.dat output_prefix
```

Output: `output_prefix.DX2` binary file, and optionally `.DXM` metadata.

### DX2 format:
